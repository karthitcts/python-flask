      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Telecom Service Providers are rapidly transforming their legacy networks to support new IP and Multimedia services. Network equipment manufacturers (NEMs) face a constant challenge to expedite the development, testing and deployment of new network elements that offer a wide range of value-added, revenue generating services. Testing of such complex network elements in a service-oriented network in terms of interoperability, service quality and end-user experience often pose a significant challenge.
